# BCR_LCP_GSA

Multi-string eBWT/LCP/GSA(DA/SA) computation

Note:

BCR_LCP_GSA can compute at the same time:

- the (extended) Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (multi-string BWT)
- the longest common prefix array (optional)
- the generalize suffix array (optional):
    - document array (DA[i] corresponds to the ID of the sequence of the symbol ebwt[i])
    - suffix array (SA[i] corresponds to the position of the sequence of the suffixes associated to the symbol ebwt[i])
    
of a very large collection of strings having different or same length. 


One can set the parameters in Tools.h

The output format can be:
- EGSA (OUTPUT_FORMAT_EGSA must be 1). The end-marker in .bwt file is the symbol '\0' [https://github.com/felipelouza/egsa]
- three files: .bwt, .lcp, .da, posSA (OUTPUT_FORMAT_EGSA must be 0). The end-marker in .bwt file is the symbol '#'


COMPILE

First: set the parameters (data structured that must be computed, types, and so on...) in parameters.h 

Second: make


RUN

./BCR_LCP_GSA inputFile outputFile 0
