Note:

BCR_LCP_GSA can compute at the same time:

- the (extended) Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (multi-string BWT)
- the longest common prefix array (optional, set BUILD_LCP to 1)
- the generalize suffix array (optional):
    - document array (DA[i] corresponds to the ID of the sequence of the symbol ebwt[i]), set BUILD_DA to 1
    - suffix array (SA[i] corresponds to the position of the sequence of the suffixes associated to the symbol ebwt[i]), set BUILD_SA to 1
    
of a very large collection of strings having different or same length. 

The output format can be:
- EGSA (OUTPUT_FORMAT_EGSA must be 1). The end-marker in .bwt file is the symbol '\0' [https://github.com/felipelouza/egsa]
- four files: .bwt, .lcp, .da, posSA (OUTPUT_FORMAT_EGSA must be 0). The end-marker in .bwt file is the symbol '#'

One should set the parameters in Tools.h

Default:
- Build eBWT/LCP/DA.
- Types: uchar for eBWT, uchar (max length of sequences 256) for LCP and uint for DA (BUILD_LCP==1 and BUILD_DA==1)  
- Store distinct files: OUTPUT_FORMAT_EGSA == 0

For instance, the data structures LCP and SA depends on the setting of dataTypeLengthSequences/dataTypelenSeq.
If your dataset contains sequences having a length greater than 256, you should set dataTypeLengthSequences to 1, so that dataTypelenSeq is set to uint. 

COMPILE


First: set the parameters (data structured that must be computed, types, and so on...) in parameters.h 


Second: make


RUN

./BCR_LCP_GSA inputFile outputFile 0


Example:

./BCR_LCP_GSA test/7seqsVar.fa test/7seqsVar.fa.out 0
